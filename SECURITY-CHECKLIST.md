openssl s_client -connect your-domain.com:443 -servername your-domain.com
```

### 🛡️ Security Headers

curl -I https://your-domain.com | grep -E "(Content-Security|X-Frame|X-Content|X-XSS|Referrer|Permissions)"
```

### 🔐 Authentication & Session Management
- [ ] JWT tokens stored in secure HttpOnly cookies
- [ ] Session timeout implemented (24 hours default)
- [ ] Automatic token refresh mechanism
- [ ] Rate limiting for login attempts (5 per 5 minutes)
- [ ] Strong password requirements enforced
- [ ] Legacy localStorage authentication cleared

**Verification:**
- [ ] Login with valid credentials
- [ ] Verify token is not in localStorage
- [ ] Test rate limiting with multiple failed attempts
- [ ] Verify session expires after timeout

### 🚫 Input Validation & XSS Protection
- [ ] All user inputs sanitized with SecurityUtils.sanitizeInput()
- [ ] HTML content escaped with SecurityUtils.sanitizeHTML()
- [ ] Email validation implemented

- [ ] CPF validation (for Brazilian users)
- [ ] Phone number validation
- [ ] Malicious input detection and logging

**Verification:**
- [ ] Try submitting `<script>alert('xss')</script>` in forms
- [ ] Verify input is sanitized, not executed
- [ ] Check security logs for malicious input detection

### 🛡️ CSRF Protection
- [ ] CSRF tokens generated for all forms
- [ ] Tokens validated on server-side (backend implementation needed)
- [ ] State-changing operations protected
- [ ] Tokens included in AJAX requests

**Verification:**
- [ ] Check forms include CSRF token in headers
- [ ] Verify tokens are unique per session
- [ ] Test form submission without token (should fail)

### 📁 File Upload Security
- [ ] File type validation (whitelist approach)
- [ ] File size limits enforced (10MB default)
- [ ] File extension validation
- [ ] MIME type verification
- [ ] Malicious file detection
- [ ] Upload progress tracking
- [ ] Rate limiting for uploads (10 per 5 minutes)

**Verification:**
- [ ] Try uploading executable files (.exe, .sh)
- [ ] Try uploading oversized files
- [ ] Verify only allowed types are accepted

## ✅ High Priority Security Measures

### 🔄 Rate Limiting
- [ ] Nginx rate limiting configured
- [ ] Login attempts limited (5 per minute)
- [ ] API requests limited (30 per minute)
- [ ] General requests limited (100 per minute)
- [ ] Client-side rate limiting implemented

**Verification:**
```bash
# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..10}; do curl -I https://your-domain.com/login.html; done
```

### 🔍 Security Monitoring
- [ ] Security event logging implemented
- [ ] Failed login attempts logged
- [ ] Malicious input attempts logged
- [ ] File upload events logged
- [ ] Navigation attempts logged
- [ ] Log rotation configured (keep last 100 events)

**Verification:**
- [ ] Check browser localStorage for 'security_logs'
- [ ] Verify events are being logged
- [ ] Test log rotation with multiple events

### 🌐 Third-Party Security
- [ ] External resources loaded with SRI (Subresource Integrity)
- [ ] CDN resources verified with integrity hashes
- [ ] External API calls validated
- [ ] Currency conversion API secured

**Verification:**
- [ ] Check Bootstrap CSS includes integrity attribute
- [ ] Verify external API responses are validated

## ✅ Medium Priority Security Measures

### 📋 Form Security
- [ ] All forms use novalidate attribute
- [ ] Real-time validation implemented
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Form submission uses secure methods
- [ ] Loading states prevent double submission

**Verification:**
- [ ] Test form validation with invalid data
- [ ] Verify error messages are generic
- [ ] Check forms can't be submitted multiple times

### 🍪 Cookie Security
- [ ] Cookies set with Secure flag
- [ ] HttpOnly flag for sensitive cookies
- [ ] SameSite=Strict for CSRF protection
- [ ] Proper expiration times set
- [ ] Cookie cleanup on logout

**Verification:**
```javascript
// Check cookies in browser console
document.cookie
```

### 🔒 Data Protection
- [ ] Sensitive data not logged to console (production)
- [ ] Password fields protected from copy/paste
- [ ] Right-click disabled on password fields
- [ ] Memory cleared on page unload
- [ ] No sensitive data in URL parameters

**Verification:**
- [ ] Check browser console for sensitive data
- [ ] Try copying password field content
- [ ] Verify URLs don't contain tokens

## ✅ Configuration Security

### 🐳 Docker Security
- [ ] Non-root user in containers
- [ ] Minimal base images used
- [ ] Secrets not in Dockerfile
- [ ] Volume permissions properly set
- [ ] Network isolation configured

**Verification:**
```bash
docker exec -it container_name whoami
docker inspect container_name | grep -i user
```

### 📁 File Permissions
- [ ] SSL certificates have proper permissions (600 for private key)
- [ ] Configuration files not world-readable
- [ ] Upload directories have restricted access
- [ ] Log files have appropriate permissions

**Verification:**
```bash
ls -la nginx/ssl/
ls -la public/
```

### 🔧 Environment Configuration
- [ ] Sensitive configuration in environment variables
- [ ] API URLs not hardcoded in client-side code
- [ ] Debug mode disabled in production
- [ ] Error messages don't reveal system information

## ✅ Testing & Validation

### 🧪 Security Testing
- [ ] Penetration testing performed
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning completed
- [ ] SSL/TLS configuration tested
- [ ] Security headers validated
- [ ] Authentication flow tested
- [ ] Input validation tested
